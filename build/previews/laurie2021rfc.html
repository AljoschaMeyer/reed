The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 6962. It also specifies a new TLS extension that is used to send various CT log artifacts.</p><p>Logs are network services that implement the protocol operations for submissions and queries that are defined in this document.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
